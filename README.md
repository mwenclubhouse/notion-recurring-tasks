# Notion Recurring Tasks

## Description
Handling tasks the repeat on specific days. 

## Motivation
In Notion's Kataban Board, there isn't a way for you to repeat a task if you have a task that reoccurs every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. 
This program does that automatically. When you move your task to a completed section, it will automatically change the date, and move the task
back to not started. Yeah, pretty nifty.
